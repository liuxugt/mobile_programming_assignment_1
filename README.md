Programming assignment #1 of CS8803 Mobile Application and Services
We tried to develop Note maker app using android. We used firebase as a backend for storing and retrieving notes and user credentials. This app facilitates user to add important notes. User can sign up for free at the beginning using his\her Email-ID and preferred password. Then the same credentials can be used further for application sign-ups. User can add , as many notes as he\she wants to add and the same can be retrieved anytime in future.
